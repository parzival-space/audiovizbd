# AudioVizBD

## Description

Adds an audio visualizer behind the user modal.
This plugin was originally made for Powercord but I ported it to BetterDiscord.
I also allowed myself to make some minor changes for better performance.

## Themes

You can customize the color of the visualiser by changing the background variable in your theme:

```css
.audioVisualizer {
  background-color: pink;
}
```
